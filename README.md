Q . Given an m*n matrix inmatrix of positive integers , print an integer outnum based on the below logic :
   a)Identify all possible sets in inmatrix that contain at least four consecutive elements of the same val, either horizontally.vertically , or diagonally
   b)If only one set of consecutive elements is identified, store the value val in outnum
   c)If more than one set of consecutive elements is identified , find the smallest value and store it in outnum
   d)If no set of four consecutive elements of the same value is identified either horizontally,vertically , or diagonally ,print-1
   
   Assumptions:
   m and n will be greater than 3
   
   Input Format :
   First line will contain number of rows m of inmatrix 
   The next m lines will contain the elements of inmatrix .Each line will have n elements seperated by space.
   
   Read the input from the standard input stream.
